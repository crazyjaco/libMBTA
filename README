libMBTA 

Still very early, but the goal is to have a PHP library to interact with the 
MBTA realtime data API. 

Information on the API can be found on the MBTA Developer site: 
http://realtime.mbta.com/Portal/Home/Documents

Please don't use the provided sample API key. Also, note that the MBTA may change
the sample API key at any time, so check the dev site to make sure that you 
have the most recent version.
